Design and Implementation of a Custom Shell Using C++
=======
# 🐚 Custom Shell Project in C++

## Overview
A fully functional **Custom Shell** written in **C++**, designed to emulate the behavior of a typical Linux command-line interface.  
This project provides a simplified shell environment capable of executing system commands, handling background and foreground processes, managing jobs, and supporting features like I/O redirection and piping.

The Custom Shell offers hands-on experience in **process management**, **system calls**, and **command execution** at the OS level.

## Features

-  **Command Execution**: Supports running standard Linux commands (e.g., `ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, etc.)
-  **Process Control**: Execute commands in **foreground** or **background**
-  **Directory Navigation**: Change directories using `cd`
-  **Command History**: Maintain and view a history of executed commands
-  **Job Management**: Track, list, and manage background jobs
-  **I/O Redirection**: Handle input and output redirection (`<`, `>`, `>>`)
-  **Command Piping**: Chain multiple commands using the pipe operator (`|`)
-  **Signal Handling**: Graceful handling of `Ctrl+C` and background process signals
-  **Error Handling**: Detects invalid commands, permissions, and missing files
