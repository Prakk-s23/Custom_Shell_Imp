# Custom_Shell_Imp
Design and Implementation of a Custom Shell Using C++
=======
The Custom Shell project is a simple command-line program built in C++ that works like a basic Linux terminal. It takes commands from the user and executes them, either in the foreground or background. The shell supports common operations such as changing directories, listing jobs, checking command history, and exiting the program. It can also handle input and output redirection using symbols like <, >, and >>, and allows connecting multiple commands using a pipe (|). Through this project, I learned how a shell interacts with the operating system using system calls like fork(), execvp(), and wait(). I also understood how processes are created and managed in Linux, how redirection and signals work, and how job control is implemented. This project helped me gain a better understanding of process management, command execution, and low-level programming in C++.
